# Project 1: Analyzing Borrowerâ€™s Risk of Defaulting
* Preprocessed data to identify and fill in missing values
* Deleted duplicated data
* Categorized data to test hypothesesEngineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Built a report for the bankâ€™s loan division to identify whether certain factors would impact a customerâ€™s credit worthiness

# Project 2: What Sells a Car?
* The following parameters were studied: price, vehicleâ€™s age when the ad was placed, mileage, number of cylinders and conditions.
* Determined outliers for each parameter and removed them.
* Analyzed numbers of ads and average price for each type of vehicle  
* â€¢	Determined which factors impacted price the most by testing different hypotheses.

# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
